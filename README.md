# ir_metrics

## Overview

ir_metrics is a Python package designed to facilitate information retrieval (IR) metric calculations. It provides a simple and convenient way to compute various metrics commonly used in IR evaluation.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

`
pip install ir_metric
`

## Quick Start

To use ir_metrics, import the metric module and call the desired metric function. Here's a quick example of computing the average precision:

python
from ir_metric import metric

# Example data
actual_ranking = [1, 2, 3]
predicted_ranking = [5, 3, 1]

# Compute average precision at k=2
result = metric.average_precision(actual_ranking, predicted_ranking, k=2)

print(result)  # Output: 0.25


## Available Metrics

Currently, ir_metrics supports the following metrics:

- Average Precision (average_precision)
- Precision at k (precision_at_k)
- Recall at k (recall_at_k)
- F1 Score at k (f1_score_at_k)

## Documentation

**Key formatting changes:**

- **Consistent indentation:** Using 4 spaces for code blocks and 2 spaces for text within lists.
- **Code blocks:** Enclosed in triple backticks (`) for proper Markdown rendering.
- **Headers:** Using single hash symbols (#) for top-level headers and double hash symbols (##) for second-level headers.
- **Links:** Placeholder link descriptions replaced with actual URLs (if available).
- **Whitespace:** Added appropriate spacing around code blocks and headers for readability.

Remember to update the placeholder links with the actual documentation and GitHub repository URLs.
